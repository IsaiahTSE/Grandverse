    <h2 class="label">Grandverse Rules</h2>
      <div class="help-content">
        <p>Like any other site, there are rules to keep it from dying. So,</p>
		
		<h2>NSFW</h2>
		<p>NSFW is not allowed anywhere on Grandverse
		<br>Grandverse is supposed to be for user of all ages, so we ask that you refrain from posting this..</p>
		<h2>Gore</h2>
		<p>Gore is forbidden everywhere. Please do not.</p>
		<h2>Language</h2>
		<p>Please use appropiate language at all times on Grandverse. Swearing is not permitted, even if you try to censor it or spell it with non-letter characters.
		<h2>Illegal content</h2>
		<p>Nobody has a problem reporting you to the authorities if you do share illegal content here, so please do not.</p>
		<h2>Spam</h2>
		<p>Please do not spam. This includes Yeahing lots of things, following lots of people, sending lots of messages, etc. Just do what you gotta do.</p>
		<h2>Hate speech</h2>
		<p>Hate Speech is also forbidden on Grandverse. If any is found, even if you are being resonable, the post will be deleted.</p>
		<h2>Hacking</h2>
		<p>If you're taking blind stabs at everything, consider <a href="https://github.com/IsaiahTSE/Grandverse-PHP">taking a look at the source</a>.
		<br>Login attempts are logged. Please do not do anything bad.</p>
		<h2>Public/joke accounts</h2>
		<p>They are unpleasant and nobody likes them. Please do not. You will be warned if you make a joke account, and public accounts (as in, accounts that have the password posted) will just be deleted.</p>
		<h2>Raids</h2>
		<p>Raid accounts will be deleted as soon as they exist. <b>If you're raiding another site, please do not discuss it here</b>.</p>
		<br>
		<hr>
		<h2>Repeals</h2>
		<p>If you want to be unbanned, try talking to an admin. Any form of contact is supported, they just need to get your message and we'll see if you can be unbanned.
		<br>This site was made by people who were mercilessly banned from many other sites without them accepting repeals, so we'll probably forgive you at some point.</p>
		<h2>Begging for moderator status</h2>
		<p>If you <i>only</i> beg for mod status and do nothing else on the service, you will probably be given a warning, if not a ban. Please do not.</p>
		<h2>Age</h2>
		<p>Age doesn't matter. Grandverse is a kid friendly Miiverse Clone, so any one can join.</p>
		<br><hr>
		<h2>Wow, this is way too strict. I am dissatisfied.</h2>
		<p>I'm sorry if the rules appear too long or strict. This page has been re-done 2 times so far, and it has attempted to be simplistic, but it is not, and we have tried our hardest to make it appear as simple as possible.
		<br>Chances are that if you aren't unpleasant, not all of these rules will be strictly enforced.</p>
